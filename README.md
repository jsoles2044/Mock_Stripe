# Stripe Subscription Behavior Analysis

This project explores subscriber behavior across different pricing tiers using mock Stripe subscription data. I investigated churn trends, pause patterns, and upgrade/downgrade movement over time to provide insights into plan stability and user satisfaction.

## Key Questions Explored
- Are users more likely to pause before they churn?
- Which plan is most stable and which is losing trust?
- Where are subscribers switching from—and to?

## Key Findings
- **Premium** shows the strongest growth with minimal churn and high switch-ins—ideal for retention and upselling.
- **Basic** peaked early in churn but recovered well. Users tend to pause before canceling, indicating thoughtful retention behavior.
- **Standard** plan is volatile. It showed double churn peaks and plateaued pause behavior, suggesting a need to revisit its value proposition.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- SQLite + SQL queries
- Jupyter Notebook (with visual storytelling)
- AI-assisted coding, human-led analysis

## My Role
While I used AI (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to streamline code generation, I made the core analytical decisions:
- Designed the behavioral questions
- Interpreted plots through a business lens
- Wrote all insights and trend diagnostics
This reflects how I work: efficient with tools, thoughtful with data.
